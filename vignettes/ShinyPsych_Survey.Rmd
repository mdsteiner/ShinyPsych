## Description

ShinyPsych - Survey, is an implementation of a survey, here three questions one must answer to cross the bridge of death [Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail), created with the ShinyPsych package [more on bridges of death, there also called probability bridges, in @field2016adventure]. 

Surveys are one of the most important methods of gathering information in studies. ShinyPsych provides a way of including surveys and instructions in an app by simply giving it a text file with the survey.

## Common Extensions

For a full description of the layout of the code underlying ShinyPsych - Survey, click here [ShinyPsych - Survey Code Description](ShinyPsych_SurveyCode.html). Here is a brief description of some ways you can easily extend ShinyPsych - Survey:

### Check if an entered id is already contained in a dataset

If you conduct your study and want to make sure that some participants who, e.g., participated in an earier similar study, cannot participate, ShinyPsych provides the possibility of loading a dataset of ids and checking whether the entered id matches one from the dataset. To do this, you simply need to extend `nextPage()` with the *check* arguments (all arguments of that function that start with *check*). For a full code example [click here](ShinyPsych_CheckIdCode.html)

### Use different input formats

To use different input formats, you can simply change the input format specified in the *type* variable of a row in the text file containing the survey information. [Click here](ShinyPsych_Textfiles.html) for a tutorial on how to create such a text file with a template for every input type.
