\usage{
createDfeList(
  nOpts = NULL,
  nOutcs = NULL,
  loadFile = TRUE,
  fileName = "TwoOptExample",
  gambleList = NULL,
  sepFile = "\\t",
  defaultGambles = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{nOpts}{integer. The number of gambles to be presented in each trial.
Currently all trials need to have the same number of options. If you have
different number of options create two separate lists}

\item{nOutcs}{integer. The maximum number of outcomes a gamble can have, i.e.
if the list contains one 5 outcome gamble and the rest 2 outcome gambles
then set this value to 5. Different number of outcomes in a gamble list are
possible.}

\item{loadFile}{logical. If TRUE (default) the list specifying
the gambles will be loaded from a local file.}

\item{fileName}{string. Either a name if a default list is used
or a full directory to the file that should be read in. See details for
currently available default lists.}

\item{gambleList}{data.frame. Values specifying the gamble parameters. Only
needed if loadFile is FALSE.}

\item{sepFile}{string. The separator in the to be loaded file. Is
passed to sep in read.table.}

\item{defaultGambles}{logical. If TRUE (default is FALSE) one of the
default lists is used.}

\item{nDraws}{integer. Specifies the lenght of the vector containing the
gamble outcomes. This is the maximum number of samples the participant can
take. Set this to a large enough value from which you expect that it will
not be reached (default is 100).}

\item{randomizeHorizontal}{logical. If TRUE (default) options
displayed in one trial are positioned in random order.}

\item{randomizeVertical}{logical. If TRUE (default) trial order is randomized}

\item{practiceTrial}{data.frame. Contains information for a practice trial.
Is only needed if withPracticeTrial is TRUE and practiceFileName is NULL.}

\item{withPracticeTrial}{logical. If TRUE (default is FALSE) a practice
trial has to be provided and is included.}

\item{practiceFileName}{string. Full path and file name of the
file to load the practice trial info in}
}
\value{
A list containing lists with the option order (horizontal order),
 outcomes, data frame containing the gamble parameters, number of draws from
 a gamble, number of options, number of outcomes and gamble order (vertical
 order).
}
\description{
Create a list of values drawn from the specified gambles that are then later
displayed. The values, i.e. outcome and probabilities etc. must be specified
and given as input. For each gamble a vector of length nDraws is created
containing values of the outcomes drawn from \code{\link[base]{sample}} with the
in the list specified probabilities. These values can later be sampled by
calling \code{\link{multiOptsDfePage}} that will set up the html logic.
