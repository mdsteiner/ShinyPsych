createCtrlList(
  firstPage,
  globIds,
  complCode = FALSE,
  complName = NULL,
  oVars = NULL,
  oVarVals = NULL,
  task = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{firstPage}{string. The id of the first page to be displayed}

\item{globIds}{string. A vector containing the ids of the
different pages to be displayed (such as instructions or questionnaires but
not tasks). Only pages that have a list either created by
\code{\link{createPageList}} or are in the same form have to be indicated
here. A hardcoded single page has not to be indicated here.}

\item{complCode}{logical. If TRUE (default is FALSE) a completion code
will be created and complName should be specified.}

\item{complName}{string. Will be the beginning of the completion code.
The completion code will be in the form "complName-XXX-XXX-XXX" where XXX is
a randomly drawn number between 100 and 999. This code can then be displayed
to the participant that he can enter e.g. as code on Amazon MTurk.}

\item{oVars}{string. Vector with the name(s) of additional
variables that should be added to ctrlList.}

\item{oVarVals}{sting or numeric. Vector containing the values that should be
appended to the oVars variables. Must be the same length as oVars.}

\item{task}{string. Vector with names indicating which task will be
played in the app. Valid inputs are: "bandit", "bart" "dfe", "dfd" or "dd"
or any combination of these. For each given task the respective
variables necessary will be appended.}
