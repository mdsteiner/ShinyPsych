\arguments{
\item{pageId}{string. Current page id.}

\item{ctrlVals}{list of reactive values. Controls the flow through the
Experiment. Can be created with \code{\link{createCtrlList}}.}

\item{nextPageId}{string. Id of the next page that should be displayed.}

\item{pageList}{list. The one returned by \code{\link{createPageList}} or one
of the same structure.}

\item{globId}{string. The global id of the set of pages or questionnaire as
specified in \code{\link{createCtrlList}}.}

\item{checkAllowed}{logical. If TRUE (default is FALSE) an id check is done
with \code{\link{checkId}} to make sure a participant is allowed to
participate.}

\item{checkAllowedPage}{integer. The page number of the set of pages with this
pageId after which the id should be checked. Only needed if checkAllowed is
TRUE.}

\item{checkIdVar}{string or numeric. The user id to check.}

\item{checkLocation}{string. Where to get the reference database from. Must
be one of "local", "dropbox" or "vector". "local" will load a txt or rds file.
"dropbox" will load a csv file from the indicated dropbox account and "vector"
assumes that you gave a vector of ids as input to idsVec. Only needed if
checkAllowed is TRUE.}

\item{checkSep}{string. Passed to the \code{\link[utils]{read.table}} sep argument.
Must match the separater used in the database file.  Only needed if
checkAllowed is TRUE.}

\item{checkHeader}{logical. Passed to the read.table header argument. Only
needed if checkAllowed is TRUE.}

\item{checkDropDir}{string. The directory in the dropbox from which to read
in the database. Must only be specified if checkLocation is set to "dropbox".
Only needed if checkAllowed is TRUE.}

\item{checkFileName}{string. The database file-name, including path. Must be
specified if checkLocation is one of "dropbox" or "local".Only needed if
checkAllowed is TRUE.}

\item{checkDroptoken}{string. The name of the rds file containing the access
tokens of the dropbox account from which the data should be loaded. If file
is outside the app directory full directory must be included. Only needed if
checkAllowed is TRUE.}

\item{checkIdsVec}{string. Vector of ids that are no longer allowed to
participate. Must only be specified if checkLocation is set to "vector".
Only needed if checkAllowed is TRUE.}

\item{checkNotAllowedId}{string. The name (default is "not allowed") of the
page that should be displayed in case the given id is occurring in the
database. Only needed if checkAllowed is TRUE.}

\item{inputList}{The input object of the shiny app.}

\value{
Updated ctrlVals. Doesn't need to be assigned, since it is a reactive
 value.

\description{
If all questions on a page are answered or the participant has read all the
text, this function will (if properly set up, this has to be handled in the
app) be called if the continue button is pressed. It is possible to have an
id check to make sure a participant is allowed to participate.
