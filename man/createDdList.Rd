\usage{
createDdList(
  loadFile = TRUE,
  fileName = "DDExample",
  ddList = NULL,
  sepFile = "\\t",
  defaultList = FALSE,
  randomizeVertical = TRUE,
  practiceTrial = NULL,
  withPracticeTrial = FALSE,
  practiceFileName = NULL,
  outcomeCurrency = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{loadFile}{logical. If TRUE (default) the list specifying
the outcome time pairs will be loaded from a local file.}

\item{fileName}{string. Either a name if a default list is used
(currently available is "DDExample") or a full directory to the file that
should be read in.}

\item{ddList}{data.frame. The data frame specifying the outcome time pairs
needed to create the tables. Is not used when loadFile is set to TRUE.}

\item{sepFile}{string. The separator in the to be loaded file. Is passed to
sep in read.table.}

\item{defaultList}{logical. If TRUE (default is FALSE) a default list from
the package is be used.}

\item{randomizeVertical}{logical. If TRUE (default) the order of
the trials (i.e. the rows) is randimized.}

\item{practiceTrial}{data.frame. Of the same structure as ddList containing one
practice trial. Only has to be specified if withPracticeTrial is set to TRUE
and practiceFileName is NULL.}

\item{withPracticeTrial}{logical. If TRUE (default is FALSE) a practice
trial has to be provided and is included.}

\item{practiceFileName}{strin. Either a name if a default list is used
(currently available is "DDExample") or a full directory to the file that
should be read in.}

\item{outcomeCurrency}{string. The currency that should be
displayed after the outcome values (e.g. "$"). If not specified only the
numbers will be displayed.}
}
\value{
A list containing the prepared html tables of the outcomes, the data
 frame from the input file or list, the trial order and the number of trials.
}
\description{
Create a list of tables that are then later displayed. The values, i.e.
outcome and time etc. must be specified and given as input. For each outcome
time pair a still incomplete html table is created to later be completed and
displayed by \code{\link{ddPage}} (It's incomplete because some
parameters need to be specified later on).

  ddContainer <- createDdList(defaultList = TRUE, fileName = "DDExample",
                              withPracticeTrial = TRUE, outcomeCurrency = "$")
  ddContainer
