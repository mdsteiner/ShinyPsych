\description{
Take a list of a specified format and save it to the specified location. All
elements in the list must be either of same length or of length 1 because
\code{\link[base]{as.data.frame}} will be called on the list. The file name is
created by pasting partId, Sys.time(), digest(data) and the suffix (and of
course the file specification .rds or .csv).
